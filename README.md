# Relatively Universal-ROM-Programmer
 
This is meant to be a cheap way to program W27C512 EEPROMs which require 14V erasure voltage and 12V programming voltage... Or basically any other 24/28 pin ROM requiring either 5V, 12V or 14V programming voltage. 

Requires a prototyping board with a processor or microcontroller. Like a 65uino or Arduino Uno for instance. 

Work in progress! Unfinished!
